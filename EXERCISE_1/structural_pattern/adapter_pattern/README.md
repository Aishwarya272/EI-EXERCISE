## **Adapter Pattern for Managing Guest Operating Systems with VirtualBox**

In the context of VirtualBox acting as an adapter, it enables various guest operating systems (Linux, Ubuntu, etc.) to run on a host operating system (Windows) by adapting their interfaces to a common format that the host OS can understand and manage.

The Adapter Pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping one interface around another. 

By using the Adapter Pattern, the VirtualBoxAdapter allows different guest operating systems to be managed seamlessly through a common interface, making it easier to control and integrate various systems into a unified management solution.
