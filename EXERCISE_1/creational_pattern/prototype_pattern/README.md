This is the implementation of prototype pattern for **Cloning Content Delivery Network** at different places

 CDNs often require identical configurations across various locations to ensure consistent content delivery and performance. Using the Prototype Pattern, a prototype CDN configuration can be created once and then cloned to set up CDNs at different places quickly and efficiently.

This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where creating a new object is resource-intensive or when you need to ensure that the new object is an exact copy of an existing one.
